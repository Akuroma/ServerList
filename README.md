## How to add a server

First, create a folder for your server's domain in the `servers`-folder. Folder names are always the reversed domain seperated by dots and then the port.

For example, if you want to add the server on domain `example.net` and port `19132`, create the following folder schema:

```
servers (already exists)
    net
        example
            19132
```

Then, create the files `name.txt` and `description.txt` in your subfolder. Put the name of your server into `name.txt` and a description into `description.txt`.

To make it easier to understand, we've created this example in the `example`-folder.
